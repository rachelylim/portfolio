This is a personal porfolio of my most recent projects and writing. The site is built using just HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery/AJAX. If the portfolio grows to an unmanageable size, I may rebuild it on Rails, but this site is purely to exercise my front-end skills.

Features to add:
-Ability to filter thumbnails based on blog posts or projects.
-Abiltiy to scroll through thumbnails in popup frame.
-More projects and writings!
