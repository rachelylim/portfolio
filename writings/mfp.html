<p><i>Mentor for Philly</i> is an education non-profit organization that focuses on training high school students with the "social-know-how" skills for the college application process, and their eventual college experience. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-wang-831a4318">Oscar Wang</a>, CEO of MFP, has been a good friend since my days at Haverford College, so I was happy to volunteer as a grant writer and strategic consultant for MFP since January 2015. I am now excited to offer my new skills as a developer to build the MFP website, which will allow students to enjoy features, such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Search for college mentors based on specialty areas.</li>
  <li>Compare net cost of potential college tuitions.</li>
  <li>Access top college search resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>More features and updates soon to come!</p>
