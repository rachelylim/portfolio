<p>Built in 7 days with some buddies during our last week at Dev Bootcamp, <i>Stash</i> is a web app built to help users find their next meal. I was inspired to pitch this app idea because I often saw pictures of food on Facebook or Instagram that looked delicious. But whenever I actually had to decide on where to eat, I would forget about the photo I saw the other day. With that in mind, I wanted to build an app that not only allowed me to browse through pictures of food taken near my current location, but also allowed me to "stash" the photos, with all relevant restaurant information, to reference on later food excursions.</p>

<p><b>Technologies used:</b> Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Google Place API, Paperclip (gem), Amazon S3, HerokuApp, HTML5, CSS3</p>

</ul>
