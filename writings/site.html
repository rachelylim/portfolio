<p>"Build your own website," they said.</p>
<p>"Feature all of your projects," they said.</p>

<p>Fine. I finally got around to building this website to feature some of my projects as a developer. The site itself is a project in the works. Building this site helped me brush up on some front-end skills, mainly jQuery and AJAX. It took me three tries to get the design right. When I first started learning how to code, I built <a href="http://rachelylim.github.io" target="_blank">this hideous blog</a>. Compare that site to this one, I guess you could say I'm improving slowly.</p>

<p>This blog is built purely on HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. I also used Google Draw to design the graphics for my blog titles.</p>
